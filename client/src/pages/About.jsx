            Coveted as the ‘Paradise on Earth’, Kashmir Valley is a tourist attraction
             all year round known for its lush Mughal Gardens, glittering Dal Lake, and 
             picturesque hinterlands. But it is the winters when the combination of the lush green
              valleys and the snowcapped mountains makes the experience amazing.

            Build a snowman or engage in a snow fight in Sonmarg, enjoy skiing and cable 
            car at Gulmarg, or walk hand-in-hand with your loved one in Pahalgam. And do
             not miss a walk through the Mughal Gardens in Srinagar. So, if your winter vacation 
             in India is in your mind, Kashmir is your ultimate stop.
